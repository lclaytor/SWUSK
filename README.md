0. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  The software requires the administrator to have an active Google account, and be able to access the Internet on a computer with a web browser.

1. INSTALLATION
  To install, the web site and accompanying code and documents must be placed under the ownership of the intended adminstrative Google account. This is done by the previous owner (or the developers, in the case of the initial release). In addition, the spreadsheet containing e-mail(s) to which reports are directed should be updated to contain the e-mail address(es) to which reports should be sent.

2. OPERATION
  a. Editing Questions
    The speadsheet containing the questions to be asked of a survey-taker can be edited to add, change, or remove questions from the survey. To add or remove questions, add, change, or delete rows from the spreadsheet that contain the questions to be edited. The sheet can be accessed at the ID contained in the first line of the code.
  b. Redirecting Reports
    The spreadsheet containing the e-mail address(es) for reports can be edited to change where regular updates and alerts are sent. Editing the cells labeled "Regular Updates" and "Alerts" changes these e-mails' recipients.
